title: Building AI-powered user interfaces
---

As web engineers, we build user interfaces that make using our products simple, understandable and delightful. Over the years, we've built a toolkit of frameworks, patterns and practices to do so.

In the next few years, more and more products will be built on top of Artificial Intelligence technologies, such as generative models like OpenAI's GPT-3. In this world, which of our tools will remain helpful, and which problems will require new solutions?

In this talk, I'll explore some of the challenges our existing frameworks and mental models have in the age of generative AI. I'll also introduce novel ways of thinking about user interfaces that we've discovered while designing and building an AI-powered web application for serious writers.
