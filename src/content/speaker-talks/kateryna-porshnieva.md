title: Visualised guide to memory management in JavaScript
---

Memory management can be an overwhelming topic to navigate. This talk is the result of my journey down the rabbit hole to better understand it myself. By drawing on my research and experience, I've put together a comprehensive guide that covers everything from hardware implementation to the inner workings of V8.

We'll cover the basics of memory implementation in the computer and operating system. Then we'll talk about the challenges of managing memory in a dynamically-typed language like JavaScript, and explore how references and memory addresses work with practical examples. Finally, we'll take a deep dive into the intricacies of V8 implementation, including heap organization and garbage collection.
