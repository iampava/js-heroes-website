Hi! My name is Artem. I'm a self-taught software engineer. I've built this thing called Mock Service Worker, which has changed the lives of developers all around the world. I'm extremely thankful for that. I love testing, and I love writing and teaching about it even more. And coffee, yes, I like that one as well.
