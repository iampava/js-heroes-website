**JSHeroes** conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. Even if we attract more and more diverse audiences every year, more actions should be done to speed up the process.

With this in mind, we would like to offer a few tickets to people from underrepresented groups in the technology and/or open-source communities who may not have the opportunity to attend the JSHeroes conference for various reasons.â€‹ **These groups include but are not limited to: women, people of color, individuals with a disability, minority ethnic people, LGBTQIA people, and others.** Your privacy, details, and answers will only be shared with the organizers.

This application is for one conference ticket only. The ticket includes admission to all the events (**18-19 May**) and catering for the days of the conference. All attendees are required to agree with the code of conduct of the event. Please read it before applying: <a href="/coc"> Code of Conduct</a>.

To apply for our diversity tickets please fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/Aa3KR3LUQRvqsmTG8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">form</a>. Applications are open until **15th of March**.
